# Simple graph library

In this library two types of graphs are supported:
* Directed graph
* Undirected

For each of the graph you can perform the following operations:
* Add vertex
* Add edge
* Get any path between existing edges
* Get optimal path between existing edges

All operations in the graph are thread-safe.
